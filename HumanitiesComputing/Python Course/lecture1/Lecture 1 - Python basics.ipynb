In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use **natural language elements**, be easier to use, or may **automate** (or even **hide** entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of **abstraction** provided defines how \"high-level\" a programming language is.\n",
