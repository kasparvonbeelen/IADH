He's made blunder after blunder of overt self-incrimination treated passively by the GOP Congress, who knows he's an imbecile and eager to serve as their rubberstamp for bad legislation. They've been using Trump as much as possible - this being hobbled by the monumental stupidity of the man. They knew his kleptocratic, scandal-ridden, massively corrupt administration was unsustainable. If they really didn't want a way to get rid of the imbecile when the time came, why approve the appointment of Mueller - a former lauded FBI director and bulldog organized crime prosecutor who brought down Gotti, the Gambinos and Enron? He plays rough, he plays smart and he plays to win. He's been busy chewing up all the participants in Trump/Russia and more damning revelations are soon to come down as well as more indictments. He's the perfect means of keeping Congressional hands clean - which is why their investigations into campaign fraud collusion with Russia have been an obvious joke. The 300 odd lawyers in Congress know this, even the dimmest ones, who'll be caught up in the investigation as it progresses. This is why Ryan is retiring. He knows he'll be tainted by investigation/prosecution. Once Trump is indicted - or egregious charges and evidence made public leading to indictment, trial and impeachment - they'll all pull away and make Corker and Flake noises as to his perfidy, even though his perfidy is really an echo of their own. Bill Palmer is right in that respect -- but he's wrong as to the GOP enablers of the imbecile standing against him at present. They aren't. A couple of tepid rejections out of a vast number of judicial appointments means they're not ready to feed him to the wolves just yet. I don't doubt that they will - and, now signed, this last rancid, repulsive piece of legislation is certainly the turning point after which Congress will start denying douchebag en masse, and serious, non optical impeachment moves will begin to be made in the House. I even believe Mueller will indict him (and may already have) letting him know at their upcoming ""status meeting."" Geeze, I'm long winded. :P :P :P"	2018-01-24T08:13:57+0000	0

Each person should be recognized as an individual citizen as far as the government is concerned. So to the government if a person has a baby then each parent is responsible for 50% of that child's needs and each  get 50% custody. Each person files single and gets that deduction and a half deduction for the kid. When people belong to some kind of faith that promotes marriage then they can get married all they want but the government still treats them as individuals so there is no incentive monitarily for getting married and the government doesn't have to worry about same sex marriage or any other resources going against someone's beliefs. Your driver's license will still say Susan Johnson and John Smith but religiously or spiritualy you might call each other spouses but to the government each person has to support themselves. If you are buying community property both parties sign a contract on the purchased property and if you separate then each gets the portion they have paid for or what ever the agreement was when you bought it. If this was the situation I wonder just how important the union of marriage would be to everyone screaming for it. If there are no benefits, deductions, health care, or anything monetary to be gained by people from the government then marriage would only be a union of two people in love period, which I think is all it should be. But that is just my opinion. I based this off the premise that marriage was born out of religion which was originally intertwined with any type of government and thats how government got involed in it in the first place but since we wanted a division between the two then let's do it and it will be fair to all! That way when for example a baptist couple wants to buy a wedding cake they can go to a Baptist wedding store and get what they want without the government telling the owner they have to make one for someone they don't belive should get married. Same sex couples can go the same sex wedding store and get a cake from a baker who belives that way. Problem solved no one going to the government saying I want equal treatment by people who don't believe in my beliefs. Keep it separated and don't bog down the government with this because it should only be about two people who love each other and want to be joined to each other by that proclamation of love not any type of government law or benefits."	2018-01-24T06:22:20+0000	2

Alabama's decision to eliminate marriage licenses doesn't prevent marriages in church, and does not prevent a church from issuing a certificate of marriage.   If couples had to return to the church to ask permission to end the marriage (as is done in the Catholic church), it might slow down the numbers of divorces.  No, I am not Catholic.  I just don't see the connection between government requiring a license and marriage in the eyes of God.  Ministers of God conduct marriage ceremonies, which can be done in a church or anywhere.  I support Alabama's decision.  It makes sense to me."	2018-01-24T07:52:50+0000	0

First, all illegal immigrants registered under ""DACA"" shall be issued a lifetime work visa, allowing them to remain in the United States of America, work in this country, pay taxes, obtain a driver's license, etc.   They will be permitted to collect Social Security at the prescribed age limits that pertain to all U.S. citizens, provided they have paid into the program and have met the same requirements as legal citizens.  They will not be permitted to use any federal welfare program, nor any state welfare program where prohibited by law.    They will not be permitted to become U.S. citizens, nor ever have the right to vote in any Federal election.  Voting privileges for State and Local elections are determined by State laws.  Any ""DACA"" immigrant who is found to have committed a felony, regardless of jurisdiction, will lose any right to remain in the U.S. and will be deported to their country of origin.    Exceptions to the above.  Any illegal immigrant who returns to their country of origin, submits the appropriate paperwork to come to the U.S. legally will receive expedited processing, allowing return as soon as possible.  Any such individual do so, will be permitted to become a U.S. citizen provided they meet all orher criteria as prescribed by current law.  Any ""DACA"" immigrant who joins a branch of the U.S. Armed Services, as an active duty military member (not to include Reserves or National Guard) and is honorably discharged after a 4 year term, shall be immediately eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship, if they so desire.  While serving in the military, they will be afforded all rights and privileges as U.S. citizens serving in the military. Discharges for medical reason shall be treated as completing the required 4 year term, and shall receive the same services as all other medical discharges.  Discharges under other than honorable, provided no felony was committed, shall return the immigrant to their original status.  Dishonable discharges will result in deportation to the country of origin.   This is my opinion on the subject.    Illegal immigrants, regardless of who or why, should never have the right to U.S. citizenship or the right to vote and impact our laws or elected officials, with having to make some type of sacrifice.  Those who immigrated here legally paid a price to get here, whether it be monetary, time of wait, or whatever."	2018-01-24T04:46:25+0000	0

After all, at the age of 21 a lawful permanent resident may petition for their family members Do you intend to fund a border wall and provide true border enforcement?  I have been at the border and seen firsthand how thousands of lawful permanent residents violate their status by living in Mexico and yet working and drawing benefits in the US and absolutely nothing is done to stop this from happening.   What laws will be put in place so as not to have a repeat of the Section 245 Amnesty of 1994, 1997, and 2000?  The first amnesty passed by Congress in 1986 gave a blanket amnesty to 2.7 million illegal aliens. The Section 245 Amnesty of 1994, 1997 extension, and the late amnesty of 2000 allowed those who claimed to have not been able to file their paperwork the opportunity to benefit from the 1986 amnesty to the tune of 978,000 illegal aliens. What do you intend to put in place to prevent the chain migration that occurs following every single amnesty put into law in the United States?  In 2000, the Life Act Amnesty, a reinstatement of the rolling amnesty of 1994 gave another 900,000 illegal aliens blanket amnesty. What will you put in place to assure the millions of lawful immigration applicants are not pushed aside once again and told to wait while these new 800,000 illegal aliens have status given to them?   Considering the fact that illegal immigration into the United States has increased exponentially since the first amnesty was given, what steps do you intend to take to assure that our border is secured, immigration laws are actually enforced, and no more illegal aliens enter the United States. What do you intend to do about visa overstays who are not tracked or removed?  What do you intend to do about the growth of the anchor baby?  What do you intend to do about illegals having the right to vote, attend school, receive tax payer funded medical care, etc.?  At what point will you and the rest of Congress and the Senate put Americans first?  Considering that three quarters of all illegal aliens are from Mexico, what will you do to stop the bloodless overtaking of the United States? What will you do to make Mexico pay for their citizens?   I wonder if you will take any steps at assuring that none of these DACA recipients have ever unlawfully voted an election.  After all, it is only because so many have voted in our elections that this is even a priority."	2018-01-24T02:39:22+0000	17

Here is the list of motions that Democrats have made to reopen the government from House Democratic Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer’s office: 1). Mr. Hoyer asked  – Republicans said no. 2). Mr. Cicilline asked  – Republicans said no. 3). Mr. Hoyer asked again – Republicans said no. 4). Mr. Pocan asked - Republicans said no. 5). Ms. Jackson Lee asked – Republicans said no. 6). Mr. Raskin asked – Republicans said no. 7). Ms. Kuster asked – Republicans said no. 😎. Ms. Schakowsky asked – Republicans said no. 9). Mr. Lieu asked – Republicans said no. 10). Ms. Jayapal asked – Republicans said no. 11). Senator McCaskill asked unanimous consent that the Senate take up H.R.1301 to provide for pay and death benefits for members of the Armed Services, and that the bill, as amended be passed. Republicans said no. 12). Senator Nelson asked unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to take up H.R.1301, a continuing resolution to fund the government through Saturday, January 20. Republicans said no. 13). Senator Tester asked unanimous consent that that the Senate take up H.R.1301, a continuing resolution to fund the government through Monday, January 22. Republicans said no. 14). Senator Stabenow asked unanimous consent that the Senate adopt a Stabenow-Casey-Brown proposal to provide for permanent CHIP funding, a five year extension of the Community Health Centers Program, and extensions of other expired Medicaid, Medicare, and health extenders. Republicans said no. 15). Senator Cardin asked unanimous consent that the Senate adopt a bill to provide for compensation of Federal employees affected by lapses in appropriations. Republicans said no. 16). Senator Tim Kaine asked unanimous consent that the Senate adopt a bill to end the Trump shutdown with a three-day continuing resolution to fund the government through Tuesday, January 23. Republicans said no. Republicans could end the government shutdown anytime they wanted, and they are choosing not to do so. The attempt by Trump and his party to blame Democrats ran out of steam almost as soon as it started. Outside of the Fox News/conservative media bubble/Trump Twitter account Axis of Misinformation, no one is buying that Democrats are responsible for shutting down a government that Republicans control. Democrats are trying to get the government open, and the reality is that Republicans are refusing to work with others. The party of President ""Art of the Deal"" can't work with others..."	2018-01-24T02:39:00+0000	0

Clearly if HE is held to the same standard that he wanted for our newly elected president then he would clearly be not only unqualified but grossly negligent in his duty to perform said duties for the Citizens of Hawaii. I am saddened that this person while well intended can’t seem to shift gears and even claim to be remotely able to the task at hand.

He has the wit of Mark Twain, the hands of a Larry Bird and he's a dead ringer for Robert Redford. He dances like Fred Astaire and he's hung like Secretariat. He graduated summa cum laude from Wharton then went on to lead the NY Yankees to 3 World Series. When his country called he was ready and he served with John Rambo, earning the Congressional Medal of Honor. He returned home to try and make his own way in the world. By day he built thrusting skyscrapers that made Ayn Rand spontaneously orgasm. By night he fought arch criminals for the soul of his city. His book ' The Art of The Deal ' was made into an Oscar, Grammy and Tony award winning musical. ( He was offered a lifetime achievement award Emmy but turned it down because it just wasn't gold enough ) During his many years in the New York construction business he NEVER ever met anybody from the Mafia despite his mentor Roy Cohn being a notorious Mob fixer/consigliere. He dearly loves his highly educated supermodel wife and has NEVER had lustful thoughts about his daughter Ivanka. His 3 Atlantic City casinos make a fortune and he's a committed Christian philanthropist. He bestrides the world like a Colossus. The Pope offered him a sainthood. In the 2016 Trumpslide he won by 30 million votes despite Obama bussing 3 million Kenyans into New Hampshire to vote illegally ALL 30 milllion attended the inauguration. When they hungered he divided a few loaves and fishes and fed the multitudes From the office of KellyAnne Conway , Miss Universe 1996."	2018-01-24T07:37:16+0000	0

About forty-two thousand farms folded during the last recession, and small  and medium-sized operations were particularly vulnerable.  With commodity prices still low and farm debt predicted to reach record  highs, if the market doesn’t recover soon, the country could see its  highest rate of farm closures since the nineteen-eighties.   American farmers are looking to Donald Trump for relief.   “Farmers built this country, and I was hopeful that he was going to see  that and step up to the plate for us.”   The President will soon have the chance to do just that, as Congress  readies the next version of the farm bill.  Past farm bills have tended to benefit large operations over small and  medium-size ones.  The top ten per cent of wealthiest farms received seventy-seven per cent  of commodity subsidies.  But agriculture doesn’t seem to be one of the President’s priorities, at least  not right now.   “If it were on a scale of one to ten, I don’t think it’s even on that scale...  ...And that does scare me.”"	2018-01-23T22:52:07+0000	0

There's been no crime. And in theory, everybody tells me I'm not under investigation.""  So goes President Trump's consistent refrain when asked about the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. But with the Trump and Mueller camps huddling to negotiate the terms of a possible interview, that's about to change.  There is a special category of potential witness set out in the United States Attorneys' Manual as a ""target."" A target is a person whom the prosecutor is intending to charge, what the manual calls a ""putative defendant.""  It is longstanding Department of Justice policy for prosecutors to inform a witness that he or she is a target, if asked.  Accordingly, any competent white-collar defense lawyer contemplating testimony will inquire: ""Is my client a target?""  So now, in all likelihood, Trump lawyer Ty Cobb will ask Mueller if the president is a target, and Mueller will in all likelihood answer that he is.  ""Mr. President,"" Mueller will say, ""you are a target for obstruction of justice charges.""  More specifically, Mueller will explain that the president's in hot water for trying to stop former FBI Director James Comey from going after former national security advisor Michael Flynn."	2018-01-23T23:04:14+0000	0

He was foolish enough to believe he wanted a deal that would allow nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought here as children to stay.

Trump thought he wanted a “big, beautiful wall” along the southern border, with Mexico paying the cost. Chief of Staff John F. Kelly had to explain to members of Congress that Trump never really meant a wall per se, but rather something more like a sketchy, intermittent fence. In a tweet attempting to rein in Kelly, Trump nonetheless asked American taxpayers to ante up $20 billion to build it."	2018-01-23T23:34:59+0000	0

Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has introduced a bill that would eviscerate critical financial regulations designed to restore balance to our rigged financial system. That bill, the Financial Choice Act, will soon get a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives—and we need your help to stop it.  The Choice Act aims to roll back many of the policies implemented after the 2008 financial crisis to protect working people from predatory lenders and prevent Wall Street from crashing the economy again. Once again, Rep. Hensarling and other extreme lawmakers are trying to hand more power over our  The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in 2010 to rein in predatory lending practices and excessive risk-taking on Wall Street—practices that led to the financial collapse that caused millions of everyday Americans to lose their jobs, homes and retirement savings less than a decade ago.  If this bill is passed, many of the most important policies put in place under Dodd-Frank will go down the drain.  This bill is like “Christmas in June” for financial institutions of all types. The legislation opens the doors, once again, to excessive borrowing and risky practices by too-big-to-fail banks. It would make it easier for private equity funds to manipulate the financial system and exploit investors, mortgage lenders selling predatory subprime mortgages, and payday lenders pushing products that trap consumers in a cycle of ever-increasing interest payments. It also discourages transparency by empowering greedy corporate CEOs to keep their companies’ CEO-to-worker pay ratios a secret and making it more difficult for shareholders to submit proposals for consideration at annual meetings.  This is—as our friends at Americans for Financial Reform would put it—an astonishingly terrible idea. We need to tell Congress to oppose this bill right now, before it has a chance to pick up any more momentum.  Add your name now and tell Congress to protect regulations that guard working people against a rigged financial system."	2018-01-23T20:45:32+0000	1

I was told by someone at the agriculture dept in charge of small seed permits and plants that they don't want us importing and are purposely making the rules difficult for growers in other countries and small gardeners, etc.  What gets me is our govt has imported more insects to combat other insects without proper research and these insects are destroying crops.  Someone needs to do something about this over-reaching dept.  All these rules because THEY THINK a beetle came into this country on a bonsai tree.

Here is a quick history lesson... once upon a time the US used to make television, but China was able to make them cheaper and import them and sell them cheaper then US made ones. ...every television manufacture in the US went out of business. As a result we created “anti-dumping” duty(tax if you will) which is a variable percentage to make US products more competitive with those being imported.   Solar cells and panels are EXTREMELY cheap coming from China. They pay an additional 18-84% to import, so really all this is doing is setting a 30% base standard.

My idea would be for police to be at every school! You would need two officers at bigger schools and have them patrolling the school any time children are there. This would require more officers for the police departments, trained solely for the purpose of being a school officer. Taxes would be the only way to pay for it and I know I’m willing to pay a little more to protect the children of this country. If you aren’t willing to pay extra for this then you aren’t serious about protecting these students. Metal detectors would be nice, but one step at a time.

In 2014, Robert Griffin III entered a post-game press conference wearing a shirt that said "" Know Jesus, Know Peace"" but was forced to turn it in side out by the NFL uniform inspector before speaking at the podium.

The NFL is the most profitable pro sports league in the U.S., raking in an estimated $1 billion in profits on $10.5 billion in revenue last season, figures that are sure to increase this year. Those massive profits are made possible in part by the billions of taxpayer dollars that local governments spend on teams, coupled with tax breaks worth hundreds of millions for the teams, the league, their sponsors and fans."	2018-01-24T00:21:19+0000	1

They glorify death and destruction.  It isn't about freedom.  It's about the #petrodollar.  That is what they love, desire.  They don't care about the lives lost, they are only collateral damage to the men who send children to kill other children.  It is disgusting.

For we know what happens to all great nations that become an Obamanation!! The burning bush is a picture of God Himself and of all born-again believers as they have both the Spirit of God and His inspired Word living inside their earthen vessels. Jeremiah 20:9* reveals:“His word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones; I was weary of holding it back, And I could not.” God’s children are to speak to Him in prayer and to speak His Word to those in need. Failing to release what is living inside, they burn yet are not immediately consumed. However, not yielding to the Spirit of God can cause a body to ignite because of smoldering fleshly cinders. The Spirit and the flesh are always at war against one another.“For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things you wish.” Galatians 5:17* NKJV Have you ever exploded in wrath or had temptation take control? If so, you are your own example as these are both lusts of the flesh. We will either release the Spirit’s fire or we will release our lustful nature’s sparks. Not testifying about Christ is like trying to hold fire in a cardboard box. The heat from the Spirit’s fire will quickly overcome what is holding it back and leave only the ashes of disappointment. God’s children must allow the Spirit’s holiness to have control over their fleshly tendencies, and the Word of God to master their lives.Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.” Galatians 5:16* NKJV I learned later in life that God’s children must consistently share the love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control of the Holy Spirit’s nature or fruit (Gal. 5: 22-23*) or they will experience lives that ooze out the foul odors of their flesh (Galatians 5:19-21*). Help us to be a channel of your holiness, Father God. Help us to share the Fire of your holiness so that we will avoid breaking out into the lusts of our flesh. Remember: if we have been born again, we have God’s divine Fire living in the very core of our personalities. If we fail to yield to and share His holy love with those around us, we will be in danger of bursting into fleshly deeds. Both the Holy Spirit and our fallen flesh have strong desires and are at war with each other; we choose who we will give control to. With the Spirit and the flesh, it’s an either-or situation. What or Who we are controlled by will determine how we live and what people think of us.IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD AND SAVIOR AMEN!!!!!!!!!!"	2018-01-23T16:34:14+0000	0

We elected President Trump to stop the globalism the last several presidents had headed us toward. We are the United States. We need to look out for what is best for the United States. Not Mexico, or any other country.  Real Americans took our country back from globalist elite!  We wanted our jobs and our nation back!  Our healthcare was too expensive. Mine is $700/month now (thanks to Obamacare). My car insurance is still $25 per month (from Insurance Panda), but what are the Democrats plans for that? If you look at Democrat strongholds like Detroit and New Orleans, car insurance will run you $300+ per month!   This is why polls show Putin is a better president than Obama. Putin puts his country first, while Obama put all but the US first. Make America Great Again! God bless you, Mike Pence!"	2018-01-23T15:34:03+0000	6

So, I’ll continue going to the movies for as long as Hollywood makes movies I’m interested in watching, regardless of their views because I can separate the art from the artist...

Based on previous analysis from the Center for American Progress, a mass deportation strategy would cost an average of $10,070 per person, for a total of $114 billion to remove 11.3 million people.  This figure includes the high costs that would be required to find each and every unauthorized individual. Since two-thirds of the unauthorized population have been in the country for more than a decade, they are well settled into our families, communities and schools. Finding every single person without legal status would be a logistical nightmare that would cause significant social and emotional damage to entire communities.  CAP’s $114 billion estimate also includes the cost to detain these individuals while they wait for removal, to process them through the immigration courts and to transport them abroad.  While $114 billion represents a startling sum of money, it is only the direct cost of physically deporting unauthorized immigrants. The cost to the overall economy would likely be far more.  The conservative American Action Forum, or AAF, has argued that it would take 20 years to accomplish a mass deportation program, with a full cost between $420 billion and $620 billion."	2018-01-23T15:29:05+0000	0

God save this Republic from the people we have become!"	2018-01-23T12:54:04+0000	0

The corruption issues in the news need to be contained to avoid further difficulties with the protection and access to the evidence.   On DACA, there should be a path to citizenship BEHIND those who are currently following the legal process. DACA applicants should be fully vetted. Chain migration should end. Reform should also include a clause to prevent this happening again.  Taxpayer benefits should not be provided to any ineligible non-citizen residents.  We should not legislate any special aid. Sponsors or family must provide their support. period.  Negotiating a deal that protects our process and is consistent has to emerge or there will be chaos from every corner.  I am not heartless, have great respect for those who come and obey laws and values as they assimilate,.We must justify that our taxes are going to AMERICA FIRST programs and that our ""entitlements"" are not fraudulently distributed to illegals or our own citizens. Our national debt is currently beyond our ability to recover, unless we start watching our pennies we may become nationally insolvent.

It seems like every other year we have the exact same dilemma with Federal funding and more importantly the paychecks of the millions of people who depend on the federal government to pay them for their work. There's absolutely no reason that there shouldn't be a general consensus to keep the government running while they sort out other political issues. This should not be used as a tool or a pressure point to negotiate. These politicians were elected to negotiate not use the paychecks of hard-working Americans is a tool to get their way.  The immigration system in this country is absolutely broken but change isn't simply going to come over night otherwise you have a result similar to Obama care where you are force-fed a plan that was poorly crafted that leaves the system even worse than it was before you started messing with it. If you put something into place that allows a very simple path to citizenship for a very large group of people all you do is give people an incentive to come here illegally and take advantage of those loopholes. You don't start bailing water from your basement before you fix the pipe that burst. You fix the pipe to make sure that it's solid and then you address the water that got in."	2018-01-23T13:43:44+0000	0

We should not have men & women on the front lines worrying about families back home. They need to be focused on the mission at hand.   After the budget issues are resolved,  please lead the charge to put a permanent bill in place to ensure the Military Service members Pay is never used as a bargaining chip again.   Help us not be pawns in politics.   Thanks again for trying.   Sincerely, Jennifer Ray An Army Wife"	2018-01-23T17:47:01+0000	0

WHY DID NOT ANY ONE CATCH ON?   Well I am going to share a personal experience.   Several Decades Ago I was living in Denmark. I was there legally, as a NON CITIZEN resident.  Denmark is that Socialist Paradise Mr Sanders talks about frequently....  One winter, I got very ill. Respiratory issues, so I went to a Dr.. After chatting for a while, this Dr, who got paid fully, no matter the result, without performing any tests, decided I had strained my Larynx, and ordered me to not talk for 2 weeks.  A Week later, I saw  different Dr, sicker than the week before. After Blood tests, I was put on medication to fight a serious case of pneumonia.    The next year, my room mate, also an American, got very ill. We rushed him to the Copenhagen Main Hospital, where they determined he had acute Appendicitis.  They rushed him to the operating room. He came out with matching incisions, left and right abdomen.   The Drs had opened an incision in his left abdominal wall, and when they could not find the Appendix, a nurse suggested it might have shifted, and so they opened the right side, and removed his appendix....!!!!! (btw, in case you do not know, everyone's appendix in on the right side.)  True Story.....  Make every one a Government Employee, impervious to termination, also unable to profit from personal EXCELLENCE, most motivation to learn, become expert, to truly solve problems dissipate."	2018-01-23T11:16:32+0000	17

O PRIMEIRO SER NÃO INDIGENA QUE PISOU EM TERRAS BRASILEIRAS ERA UM JUDEU_cristãos novos_atualmente catolicos... em 500 anos o exercito brasileiro,Portugal e Espanha tentaram esconder a verdadeira historia e ascendencia do povo brasileiro... Os filhos e netos de imigrantes que entraram apartir de 1964 no Brasil, entraram no país por militares CORRUPTOS_ essencialmente espanhois,portugueses,alemães,italianos,libaneses...tudo que estes construiram nl Brasil,foi mediante roubo e corrompendo autoridades publicas e generais,militares ... Nós brasileiros nativos #NÃO queremos estrangeiros,sudamericanos,africanos,islamicos no Brasil,pq depois desta imigração massiva de 1964 o Brasil se transformou em um campo de concentração,a familia nativa brasileira esta acorrentada pelos filhos e netos de imigrantes que generais brasileiros permitiram a entrada no Brasil ,depois que estes chegaram a atrocidade passou a ser imposta a familia nativa brasileira,estupros massivos a ,crianças e mulheres,assaltos,sequestros,narcotrafico,sujeira entrou no Brasil,crime, Muitos nativos brasileiros não protestam pq o unico que estes conheceram è um campo de concentração chamado Brasil,ademas do filhos e netos destes imigrantes estarem na politica ,ffaa e fazerem de tudo para desviar a atenção do mundo as atrocidades que estes cometeram e cometem no Brasil,em contra da familia brasileira nativa.. Depois que estes chegaram ao Brasil a  brasileira nativa conheceu o que  terror,sujeira e impiedade. Si um brasileiro descendente de alemão,espanhol,italiano,portugues,libanes,cometesse os atos no país de origem dos seus pais ou nos USA,, que estes cometeram e cometen no Brasil, em contra da familia brasileira nativa,pelo menos, estes estariam presos em Espanha,na Alemanha mortos ,nos USA sob pena de perpetua... #NÓS queremos que estes retornem aos seus países,ao país dos seus pais, a familia brasileira #NÃO quer estrangeiros no Brasil,queremos os nossos, #PRIMEIRO_a familia judaica, #SEGUNDO_a familia judaica, #TERCEIRO_a familia judaica... si soubessemos que a familia brasileira possuia ascendencia judaica ,jamais pediriamos auxilio a outras nações .. Por isso os judeus do mundo devem nos auxiliar,nos ajudar a limpar o Brasil,colocar para fora toda chusma,sujeira,podridão que esta entrando e entrou no Brasil,fechar e controlar as fronteiras,reforçar a segurança supranacional e preparar o Brasil para a familia brasileira nativa,familia judaica europeia,norte-americana,para vivermos em paz com nossas familias ... Sei que hoje,os filhos de imigrantes estrangeiros querem perpetuar seus politicos no poder para seguir roubando a familia brasileira nativa judaica,nós queremos politicos rabinos,religiosos judeus,como o nosso povo nativo.. #NÃO queremos sudamericanos,africanos,estrangeiros muito menos islamicos no Brasil..  O que entrou tem que sair ... algo errado passa no Brasil,em nenhum país do mundo ha mais de 60 mil civis assasinados por ano,mais de 500 estupros por dia,milhares de militares cubanos e sudamericanos travestidos de medicos exterminando a familia brasileira...incrivelmente o militar,general brasileiro sabe perfeitamente que estes não sãø medicos e sim militares sudamericanos ,e não fazem nada em defesa do povo brasileiro nativo. que os judeus do mundo nos auxiliem por favor... os judeus do mundo que ajude a familia brasileira nativa..por favor,em nome Deus.  https://youtu.be/ohGCfGkX6To"	2018-01-23T10:06:18+0000	0	video_share_youtube	https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FohGCfGkX6To&h=ATOHar22fztvhJ_7om8DvReLz_SPb9TYjLhZ5_MfTQNQOrgHvGP-33pVPtxDrQUJ6VtCP3gNDXGwQDqdjSACddyMkyDfiBdnOQ8OwwATyZ8E&s=1&enc=AZOM25LdsQ5xnwn-SJJxbBShCTWK6IGTXNpjdsFjndtnAEKV6hsOnJ25-9Hy-ZM5XSGmQsF4KekSjxMaddeHNtXw
